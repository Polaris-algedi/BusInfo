## Project Description

I've triumphantly developed a bus information website, effectively bridging a crucial gap in my city's public transportation system. Fueled by my personal frustration with the absence of real-time bus information, I embarked on a solo mission to create a solution that significantly elevates the commuting experience for all.

### Front-End Technologies

Utilizing Bootstrap 4, I strategically employed its robust framework to ensure a responsive and visually captivating user interface. This decision streamlined the design process, guaranteeing a consistent and polished appearance across various devices and screen sizes.

To enhance user experience and interactivity, I seamlessly integrated jQuery, a powerful JavaScript library. This facilitated the development of dynamic and responsive features, contributing to a more user-friendly interface.

### Back-End Technologies

At the core of the back-end, Python emerged as the programming language of choice. Its versatility and readability made it an excellent fit for developing the server-side logic, ensuring efficient handling of diverse tasks and functionalities.

For the web application framework, I opted for Flask – a lightweight yet powerful micro-framework for Python. Flask allowed me to establish a solid foundation for the application while maintaining flexibility, handling HTTP requests, routing, and overall application structure.

In the realm of database management, I integrated MySQL. This relational database system was chosen for its reliability and efficiency in handling structured data, playing a crucial role in storing and retrieving information related to bus schedules and user interactions.

To seamlessly interact with the database from the Python application, I employed SQLAlchemy – an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. This provided a high-level interface, simplifying the integration between the Python application and the MySQL database, streamlining database operations and enhancing code maintainability.

### Architecture Inspiration

Drawing inspiration from the architecture of Ruby on Rails web applications, I meticulously crafted the overall structure of the project. By adopting best practices from the Rails framework, I aimed to ensure efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. The ultimate goal was to create a robust system capable of seamlessly handling real-time bus data integration, delivering accurate and up-to-date information to users.
